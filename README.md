# Cuisine-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks


<p>Objective:
To develop a simple, user-friendly system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify images of food into specific cuisines, such as Italian, Japanese, or Mexican.</p>

<p>Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize CNNs: Apply CNNs, known for their accuracy in image recognition,
to analyze and classify food images.</li>
<li>Build a Diverse Dataset: Collect a wide range of food images representing
different cuisines for model training and testing.</li>
<li>Implement with Popular Tools: Use well-known programming tools and
libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV for building and refining the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goal:
Create an efficient tool that quickly and accurately categorizes food images into their respective cuisines, useful for culinary apps, dietary tracking, and educational purposes.</p>

<p>Expected Outcome:
A reliable and easy-to-use system that demonstrates the practical application of AI in identifying and appreciating diverse food cultures.</p>
